Seven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company.
He said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m working with three friends,
and we&amp;#39;re going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online.&amp;quot;
And I said, &amp;quot;OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;No, we all took internships just in case it doesn&amp;#39;t work out.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;All right, but you&amp;#39;re going to go in full time once you graduate.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Not exactly. We&amp;#39;ve all lined up backup jobs.&amp;quot;
Six months go by,
it&amp;#39;s the day before the company launches,
and there is still not a functioning website.
&amp;quot;You guys realize, the entire company is a website.
That&amp;#39;s literally all it is.&amp;quot;
So I obviously declined to invest.
And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.
(Laughter)
They sell glasses online.
They were recently recognized as the world&amp;#39;s most innovative company
and valued at over a billion dollars.
And now? My wife handles our investments.
Why was I so wrong?
To find out, I&amp;#39;ve been studying people that I come to call &amp;quot;originals.&amp;quot;
Originals are nonconformists,
people who not only have new ideas
but take action to champion them.
They are people who stand out and speak up.
Originals drive creativity and change in the world.
They&amp;#39;re the people you want to bet on.
And they look nothing like I expected.
I want to show you today three things I&amp;#39;ve learned
about recognizing originals
and becoming a little bit more like them.
So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker
was they were really slow getting off the ground.
Now, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator.
Well, I have a confession for you. I&amp;#39;m the opposite. I&amp;#39;m a precrastinator.
Yes, that&amp;#39;s an actual term.
You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline
when you haven&amp;#39;t done anything yet.
I just feel that a few months ahead of time.
(Laughter)
So this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously.
I would wake up at 5am,
start playing and not stop until I had mastered them.
Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came
and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.
(Laughter)
But this served me well in college,
because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline.
And I was proud of that, until a few years ago.
I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said,
&amp;quot;I have my most creative ideas when I&amp;#39;m procrastinating.&amp;quot;
And I was like, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s cute, where are the four papers you owe me?&amp;quot;
(Laughter)
No, she was one of our most creative students,
and as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test.
So I challenged her to get some data.
She goes into a bunch of companies.
She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate.
Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are.
And sure enough, the precrastinators like me,
who rush in and do everything early
are rated as less creative
than people who procrastinate moderately.
So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators.
She was like, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. They didn&amp;#39;t fill out my survey.&amp;quot;
(Laughter)
No, here are our results.
You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute
are so busy goofing off that they don&amp;#39;t have any new ideas.
And on the flip side, the people who race in
are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don&amp;#39;t have original thoughts either.
There&amp;#39;s a sweet spot where originals seem to live.
Why is this?
Maybe original people just have bad work habits.
Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.
To find out, we designed some experiments.
We asked people to generate new business ideas,
and then we get independent readers
to evaluate how creative and useful they are.
And some of them are asked to do the task right away.
Others we randomly assign to procrastinate
by dangling Minesweeper in front of them
for either five or 10 minutes.
And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators
are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups.
Now, Minesweeper is awesome, but it&amp;#39;s not the driver of the effect,
because if you play the game first before you learn about the task,
there&amp;#39;s no creativity boost.
It&amp;#39;s only when you&amp;#39;re told that you&amp;#39;re going to be working on this problem,
and then you start procrastinating,
but the task is still active in the back of your mind,
that you start to incubate.
Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas,
to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.
So just as we were finishing these experiments,
I was starting to write a book about originals,
and I thought, &amp;quot;This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate,
while writing a chapter on procrastination.&amp;quot;
So I metaprocrastinated,
and like any self-respecting precrastinator,
I woke up early the next morning
and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.
(Laughter)
And then I worked diligently
toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal.
I started writing the procrastination chapter,
and one day -- I was halfway through --
I literally put it away in mid-sentence
for months.
It was agony.
But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas.
As Aaron Sorkin put it,
&amp;quot;You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking.&amp;quot;
And along the way I discovered
that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators.
Take Leonardo da Vinci.
He toiled on and off for 16 years
on the Mona Lisa.
He felt like a failure.
He wrote as much in his journal.
But some of the diversions he took in optics
transformed the way that he modeled light
and made him into a much better painter.
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
The night before the biggest speech of his life,
the March on Washington,
he was up past 3am, rewriting it.
He&amp;#39;s sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage,
and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines.
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,
he leaves his prepared remarks
to utter four words that changed the course of history:
&amp;quot;I have a dream.&amp;quot;
That was not in the script.
By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute,
he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas.
And because the text wasn&amp;#39;t set in stone,
he had freedom to improvise.
Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity,
but it can be a virtue for creativity.
What you see with a lot of great originals
is that they are quick to start but they&amp;#39;re slow to finish.
And this is what I missed with Warby Parker.
When they were dragging their heels for six months,
I looked at them and said,
&amp;quot;You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online.&amp;quot;
They missed the first-mover advantage.
But what I didn&amp;#39;t realize was they were spending all that time
trying to figure out how to get people
to be comfortable ordering glasses online.
And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth.
Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories,
comparing the first movers who created the market
with the improvers who introduced something different and better.
What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent,
compared with only 8 percent for the improvers.
Look at Facebook, waiting to build a social network
until after Myspace and Friendster.
Look at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo.
It&amp;#39;s much easier to improve on somebody else&amp;#39;s idea
than it is to create something new from scratch.
So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don&amp;#39;t have to be first.
You just have to be different and better.
But that wasn&amp;#39;t the only reason I passed on Warby Parker.
They were also full of doubts.
They had backup plans lined up,
and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original,
because I expected that originals would look something like this.
(Laughter)
Now, on the surface,
a lot of original people look confident,
but behind the scenes,
they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do.
They just manage it differently.
Let me show you: this is a depiction
of how the creative process works for most of us.
(Laughter)
Now, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt.
There&amp;#39;s self-doubt and idea doubt.
Self-doubt is paralyzing.
It leads you to freeze.
But idea doubt is energizing.
It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine,
just like MLK did.
And so the key to being original
is just a simple thing
of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.
Instead of saying, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m crap,&amp;quot;
you say, &amp;quot;The first few drafts are always crap,
and I&amp;#39;m just not there yet.&amp;quot;
So how do you get there?
Well, there&amp;#39;s a clue, it turns out,
in the Internet browser that you use.
We can predict your job performance and your commitment
just by knowing what web browser you use.
Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study --
(Laughter)
But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users
significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users.
Yes.
(Applause)
They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way.
Why? It&amp;#39;s not a technical advantage.
The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed
and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge.
It&amp;#39;s about how you got the browser.
Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari,
those came preinstalled on your computer,
and you accepted the default option that was handed to you.
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default
and ask, is there a different option out there,
and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser.
So people hear about this study and they&amp;#39;re like,
&amp;quot;Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?&amp;quot;
(Laughter)
No, it&amp;#39;s about being the kind of person
who takes the initiative to doubt the default
and look for a better option.
And if you do that well,
you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu.
There&amp;#39;s a name for it. It&amp;#39;s called vuja de.
(Laughter)
Vuja de is when you look at something you&amp;#39;ve seen many times before
and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes.
It&amp;#39;s a screenwriter who looks at a movie script
that can&amp;#39;t get the green light for more than half a century.
In every past version, the main character has been an evil queen.
But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense.
She rewrites the first act,
reinvents the villain as a tortured hero
and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever.
So there&amp;#39;s a simple message from this story.
When you feel doubt, don&amp;#39;t let it go.
(Laughter)
What about fear?
Originals feel fear, too.
They&amp;#39;re afraid of failing,
but what sets them apart from the rest of us
is that they&amp;#39;re even more afraid of failing to try.
They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt
or by failing to start a business at all.
They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions
but our inactions.
The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science,
are the chances not taken.
Elon Musk told me recently, he didn&amp;#39;t expect Tesla to succeed.
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches
would fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back,
but it was too important not to try.
And for so many of us, when we have an important idea,
we don&amp;#39;t bother to try.
But I have some good news for you.
You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas.
A lot of people think they will.
If you look across industries
and ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion,
85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up.
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid.
But guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas,
tons of them, in fact.
Take the guy who invented this.
Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy
that it scared not only kids but adults, too?
No. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.
(Laughter)
If you look across fields,
the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most,
because they&amp;#39;re the ones who try the most.
Take classical composers, the best of the best.
Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others
and also have their compositions rerecorded more times?
One of the best predictors
is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate.
The more output you churn out, the more variety you get
and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original.
Even the three icons of classical music -- Bach, Beethoven, Mozart --
had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions
to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces.
Now, you may be wondering,
how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot?
I don&amp;#39;t know how Wagner pulled that off.
But for most of us, if we want to be more original,
we have to generate more ideas.
The Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company,
they needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations
to build a retail brand,
and they tested over 2,000 possibilities
before they finally put together
Warby and Parker.
So if you put all this together, what you see is that originals
are not that different from the rest of us.
They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate.
They have bad ideas.
And sometimes, it&amp;#39;s not in spite of those qualities but because of them
that they succeed.
So when you see those things, don&amp;#39;t make the same mistake I did.
Don&amp;#39;t write them off.
And when that&amp;#39;s you, don&amp;#39;t count yourself out either.
Know that being quick to start but slow to finish
can boost your creativity,
that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas
and embracing the fear of failing to try,
and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.
Look, being original is not easy,
but I have no doubt about this:
it&amp;#39;s the best way to improve the world around us.
Thank you.
(Applause)

2.1.1

------------------------------------------------------------
So this is a hotel room, kind of like the one I&amp;#39;m staying in.
I get bored sometimes.
A room like this has not a lot to offer for entertainment.
But for a hacker, it gets a little interesting because that television
is not like the television in your home,
it&amp;#39;s a node on a network. Right?
That means I can mess with it.
If I plug a little device like this into my computer,
it&amp;#39;s an infrared transceiver, I can send the codes that
the TV remote might send and some other codes.
So what? Well, I can watch movies for free.
(Laughter)
That doesn&amp;#39;t matter to me so much, but I can play video games too.
Hey, but what&amp;#39;s this?
I can not only do this for my TV in my hotel room,
I can control your TV in your hotel room.
(Laughter)
So I can watch you if you&amp;#39;re checking out with one of these,
you know, TV based registration things,
if you&amp;#39;re surfing the web on your hotel TV,
I can watch you do it.
Sometimes it&amp;#39;s interesting stuff.
Funds transfer.
Really big funds transfers.
You never know what people might want to do
while they&amp;#39;re surfing the web from their hotel room.
(Laughter)
The point is I get to decide if you&amp;#39;re watching Disney or porn tonight.
Anybody else staying  at the Affinia hotel?
(Laughter)
This is a project I worked on when we were trying to figure out
the security properties of wireless networks; it&amp;#39;s called the &amp;quot;Hackerbot&amp;quot;.
This is a robot we&amp;#39;ve built that can drive around and find Wi-Fi users,
drive up to them and show them their passwords on the screen.
(Laughter)
We just wanted to build a robot,
but we didn&amp;#39;t know what to make it do, so -
We made the pistol version of the same thing.
This is called the &amp;quot;Sniper Yagi&amp;quot;.
It&amp;#39;s for your long-range password sniffing action,
about a mile away I can watch your wireless network.
This is a project I worked on with Ben Laurie to show passive surveillance.
So what it is, is a map of the conference called
&amp;quot;Computers, Freedom and Privacy&amp;quot;.
And this conference was in a hotel, and what we did is we,
you know, put a computer in each room of the conference
that logged all the Bluetooth traffic.
So as everybody came and went with their phones and laptops
we were able to just log that, correlate it,
and then I can print out a map like this for everybody at the conference.
This is Kim Cameron, the Chief Privacy Architect at Microsoft.
(Laughter)
Unbeknownst to him,
I got to see everywhere he went.
And I can correlate this and show who he hangs out with
(phone dialing) when he got bored,
(phone dialing) hangs out in the lobby with somebody.
Anybody here use cellphones?
(Laughter)
(Phone ringing)
So my phone is calling -
(Ringing)
calling -
Voice mail: You have 100 messages.
Palbos Holman: Uh oh!
VM: First unheard message -
PH: Where do I press -
VM: Message skipped. First skipped message.
PH: Uh oh!
VM: Main menu. To listen to your - You have pressed an incorrect key -
You have two skipped messages. Three saved messages.
Goodbye.
PH: Uh oh! So we&amp;#39;re in Brad&amp;#39;s voice mail.
(Laughter)
And I was going to record him a new message,
but I seem to have pressed an invalid key,
so we&amp;#39;re going to move on.
And I&amp;#39;ll explain how that works some other day because we&amp;#39;re short on time.
Anybody here used MySpace?
MySpace users? Oh!
Used to be popular. It&amp;#39;s kind of like Facebook.
This guy, a buddy of ours Samy, was trying to meet chicks on MySpace
which I think is what it used to be good for.
And what he did is he had a page on MySpace about him.
It lists all your friends, and that&amp;#39;s how you know
somebody&amp;#39;s cool is that they have a lot of friends on MySpace.
Well, Samy didn&amp;#39;t have any friends.
He wrote a little bit of Javascript code that he put in his page,
so that whenever you look at his page
it would just automagically add you as his friend.
And it would skip the whole acknowledgement response protocol
saying &amp;quot;Is Samy really your friend?&amp;quot;
But then it would copy that code onto your page,
so that whenever anybody looked at your page
it would automatically add them as Samy&amp;#39;s friend too.
(Laughter)
And it would change your page to say that &amp;quot;Samy is your hero.&amp;quot;
(Laughter)
So in under 24 hours, Samy had over a million friends on MySpace.
(Laughter)
Hey, he just finished serving 3-years probation for that.
(Laughter)
Even better, Christopher Abad, this guy, another hacker,
also trying to meet chicks on MySpace but having spotty results.
Some of these dates didn&amp;#39;t work out so well,
so what Abad did is he wrote a little bit of code
to connect MySpace to Spam Assassin, which is an open source spam filter.
It works just like the spam filter in your email.
You train it by giving it some spam
train it by giving it a little bit of legitimate email,
and it tries to use artificial intelligence
to work out the difference. Right?
Well, he just trained it on profiles from girls he dated and liked
as legitimate email.
Profiles from girls he dated and not liked, as spam,
and then ran it against every profile on MySpace.
(Laughter)
Out spits girls you might like to date.
What I say about Abad is, I think, there&amp;#39;s like three startups here.
I don&amp;#39;t know why we need Match.com, when we can have Spam dating?
You know this is innovation.
He&amp;#39;s got a problem, he found a solution.
Does anybody use these - bleep - keys for opening your car remotely?
They&amp;#39;re popular in, well, maybe not Chicago, OK.
So kids these days will drive through a Wal-Mart parking lot
clicking open, open, open, bloop.
Eventually you find another Jetta or whatever just like yours,
maybe a different color, that uses the same key code.
Kids will just loot it, lock it up and go.
Your insurance company will roll over on you
because there&amp;#39;s not evidence of a break-in.
For one manufacturer we figured out how to manipulate that key
so that it will open every car from that manufacturer.
(Laughter)
There is a point to be made about this which I barely have time for,
but it&amp;#39;s that your car is now a PC, your phone is also a PC,
your toaster, if it is not a PC, soon will be. Right?
And I&amp;#39;m not joking about that.
And the point of that is that when that happens
you inherit all the security properties and problems of PC&amp;#39;s.
And we have a lot of them.
So keep that in mind, we can talk more about that later.
Anybody use a lock like this on your front door?
OK, good.
I do too.
This is a Schlage lock.
It&amp;#39;s on half of the front doors in America.
I brought one to show you.
So this is my Schlage lock.
This is a key that fits the lock, but isn&amp;#39;t cut right, so it won&amp;#39;t turn it.
Anybody here ever tried to pick locks with tools like this?
All right, got a few, few nefarious lock pickers.
Well, it&amp;#39;s for kids with OCD.
You&amp;#39;ve got to put them in there, and finick with them,
spend hours getting the finesse down to manipulate the pins.
You know, for the ADD kids in the house there&amp;#39;s an easier way.
I put my little magic key in here,
I put a little pressure on there to turn it, (Tapping)
smack it a few times with this special mallet
and I just picked the lock. We&amp;#39;re in.
It&amp;#39;s easy.
And in fact, I don&amp;#39;t really know much more about this than you do.
It&amp;#39;s really, really easy.
I have a keychain I made of the same kind of key
for every other lock in America.
And if you&amp;#39;re interested, I bought a key machine
so that I can cut these keys and I made some for all of you guys.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So my gift to you, come afterwards and I will show you
how to pick a lock and give you one of these keys
you can take home and try it on your door.
Anybody used these USB thumb drives?
Yeah, print my Word document, yeah!
They&amp;#39;re very popular.
Mine works kind of like yours. You can print my Word document for me.
But while you&amp;#39;re doing that, invisibly and magically in the background
it&amp;#39;s just making a handy backup of your My Documents folder,
and your browser history and cookies and your registry and password database,
and all the things that you might need someday if you have a problem.
So we just like to make these things and litter them around at conferences.
(Laughter)
Anybody here use credit cards?
(Laughter)
Oh, good!
Yeah, so they&amp;#39;re popular and wildly secure.
(Laughter)
Well, there&amp;#39;s new credit cards that you might have gotten in the mail
with a letter explaining how it&amp;#39;s your new &amp;quot;Secure credit card&amp;quot;.
Anybody get one of these?
You know it&amp;#39;s secure because it has a chip in it, an RFID tag,
and you can use these in Taxicabs and at Starbucks,
I brought one to show you, by just touching the reader.
Has anybody seen these before?
Okay, who&amp;#39;s got one?
Bring it on up here.
(Laughter)
There&amp;#39;s a prize in it for you.
I just want to show you some things we learned about them.
I got this credit card in the mail.
I really do need some volunteers, in fact, I need
one, two, three, four, five volunteers because the winners
are going to get these awesome stainless steel wallets
that protect you against the problem that you guessed, I&amp;#39;m about to demonstrate.
Bring your credit card up here and I&amp;#39;ll show you.
I want to try it on one of these awesome new credit cards.
OK.
Do we have a conference organizer,
somebody who can coerce people into cooperating?
(Laughing)
It&amp;#39;s by your own volition because -
This is where the demo gets really awesome
I know you guys have never seen -
(Inaudible question)
What&amp;#39;s that?
They&amp;#39;re really cool wallets made of stainless steel.
Anybody else seen code on screen at TED before?
Yeah, this is pretty awesome.
(Laughter)
OK, great I got volunteers.
So who has one of these exciting credit cards?
OK, here we go.
I&amp;#39;m about to share your credit card number
only to 350 close friends.
Hear the beep?
That means someone&amp;#39;s hacking your credit card.
OK, what did we get?
Valued customer and the credit card number and expiration date.
It turns out your secure new credit card is not totally secure.
Anybody else want to try yours while you&amp;#39;re here?
Man: Can you install overdraft protection?
PH: Beep, let&amp;#39;s see what we got?
So we bitched about this and AMEX changed it,
so it doesn&amp;#39;t show the name anymore.
Which is progress. You can see mine, if it shows it.
Yeah, it shows my name on it, that&amp;#39;s what my Mom calls me anyway.
Yours doesn&amp;#39;t have it.
Anyway, so next time you get something in the mail
that says it&amp;#39;s secure, send it to me.
(Laughter)
Oh wait, one of these is empty, hold on.
I think this is the one, yep, here you go.
You get the one that&amp;#39;s disassembled.
All right, cool.
(Applause)
I still have a few minutes yet left, so I&amp;#39;m going to make a couple of points.
(Laughter)
Oh, shit.
That&amp;#39;s my subliminal messaging campaign. It was supposed to be much faster.
Here&amp;#39;s the most exciting slide ever shown at TED.
This is the protocol diagram for SSL,
which is the encryption system in your web browser
that protects your credit card when you&amp;#39;re sending it to Amazon and so on.
Very exciting, I know, but the point is
hackers will attack every point in this protocol, right?
I&amp;#39;m going to send two responses when the server&amp;#39;s expecting one.
I&amp;#39;m going to send a zero when it&amp;#39;s expecting a one.
I&amp;#39;m going to send twice as much data as it&amp;#39;s expecting.
I&amp;#39;m going to take twice as long answering as it&amp;#39;s expecting.
Just try a bunch of stuff. See where it breaks.
See what falls in my lap.
When I find a hole like that then I can start looking for an exploit.
This is a little more what SSL looks like to hackers, that&amp;#39;s really boring.
This guy kills a million Africans a year.
It&amp;#39;s Anopheles stephensi mosquito carrying malaria.
Is this the wrong talk?
(Laughter)
This is a protocol diagram for malaria.
So what we&amp;#39;re doing in our lab is attacking this protocol
at every point we can find.
It has a very complex life cycle that I won&amp;#39;t go into now,
but it spends some time in humans, some time in mosquitos
and what I need are hackers.
Because hackers have a mind that&amp;#39;s optimized for discovery.
They have a mind that&amp;#39;s optimized for figuring out what&amp;#39;s possible.
You know, I often illustrate this by saying,
If you get some random new gadget and show it to your Mom,
she might say, &amp;quot;Well, what does this do?&amp;quot; And you&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;Mom, it&amp;#39;s a phone.&amp;quot;
And instantly, she&amp;#39;d would know exactly what it&amp;#39;s for.
But with a hacker, the question is different.
The question is, &amp;quot;What can I make this do?&amp;quot;
I&amp;#39;m going to take all the screws out, and take the back off,
and break it into a lot of little pieces.
But then I&amp;#39;m going to figure out what I can build from the rubble.
That&amp;#39;s discovery, and we need to do that in science and technology
to figure out what&amp;#39;s possible.
And so in the lab what I&amp;#39;m trying to do is apply that mindset
to some of the biggest problems humans have.
We work on malaria, thanks to Bill Gates, who asked us to work on it.
This is how we used to solve malaria.
This is a real ad from like the 40&amp;#39;s.
We eradicated malaria in the US by spraying DDT everywhere.
In the lab what we do is a lot of work to try and understand the problem.
This is a high-speed video, we have a badass video camera,
trying to learn how mosquitos fly.
And you can see that they&amp;#39;re more like swimming in air.
We actually have no idea how they fly.
But we have a cool video camera so we -
(Laughter)
Yeah, it cost more than a Ferrari.
Anyway we came up with some ways to take care of mosquitos.
Let&amp;#39;s shoot them down with laser beams.
This is what happens when you put one of every kind of scientist in a room
and a laser junky.
So people thought it was funny at first,
but we figured out, you know, we can build this out of consumer electronics.
It&amp;#39;s using the CCD from a webcam,
the laser from a Blu-ray burner,
the laser galvo is from a laser printer.
We do motion detection on a GPU processor
like you might find in video game system.
It&amp;#39;s all stuff that follows Moore&amp;#39;s law.
So it&amp;#39;s actually not going to be that expensive to do it.
The idea is that we would put
a perimeter of these laser systems around a building or a village
and just shoot all the mosquitos on their way in to feed on humans.
And we might want to do that for your backyard.
We could also do it to protect crops.
Our team is right now working on
characterizing what they need to do the same thing for
the pest that has wiped out about two thirds
of the Orange groves in Florida.
So people laughed at first.
This is a video of our system working.
We are tracking mosquitos live as they fly around.
Those crosshairs are put there by our computer.
It just watches them, finds them moving
and then it aims a laser at them to sample their wing beat frequency.
Figure out from that, is this a mosquito?
Is it Anopheles Stephensi? Is it female?
And if all that&amp;#39;s true then we shoot it down with lethal laser.
(Laughter)
So we have this working in a lab.
We&amp;#39;re working on taking that project into the field now.
All this happens at the Intellectual Ventures Lab in Seattle where I work
and we try and take on some of the hardest problems that humans have.
This is the money shot.
You can see we just burned his wing off with a UV laser.
He&amp;#39;s not coming back.
(Applause)
Kind of vaporized his wing right there, yeah.
They love it. I mean, you know.
Never got called by PETA or anyone else.
I mean, it&amp;#39;s the perfect enemy.
There&amp;#39;s just no one coming to the rescue of mosquitos.
Sometimes we overdo it.
So anyway, I&amp;#39;m going to get off stage.
This is the Intellectual Ventures Lab where I work.
Basically we use every kind of scientist
and one of every tool in the world to work on crazy invention projects.
Thanks.
(Applause)
